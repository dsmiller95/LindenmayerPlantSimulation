Extensions to the [Procedural Toolkit](https://github.com/Syomus/ProceduralToolkit) library, including integration with the [Spline Mesh](https://github.com/benoit-dumas/SplineMesh) library. Mostly focused around appending to existing MeshDrafts, and wrapping mesh drafts around a spline using the algorithm from the Spline Mesh library.
